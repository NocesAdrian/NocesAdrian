#### `Hi, I’m @KennethAdrianOriaNoces`

I'm a backend developer with experience in frontend development, but my main focus is on PHP, Laravel, and PostgreSQL for building robust and scalable web applications.  

I'm also learning C and C++ to develop native Linux software and games. I have some experience with Python as well, which helps me approach problem-solving more efficiently.  

Below are my learning projects — feel free to check them out!
